<h2>Bubble Sort</h2>
<p>Bubble Sort is the simplest sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly swapping the adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order.</p>

<h3>Worst Case Analysis for Bubble Sort:</h3>
<p>The worst-case condition for bubble sort occurs when elements of the array are arranged in decreasing order.
In the worst case, the total number of iterations or passes required to sort a given array is (n-1). where ‘n’ is a number of elements present in the array.</p>

<p><b>Worst and Average Case Time Complexity:</b> O(n*n). The worst case occurs when an array is reverse sorted.</p>
<p><b>Best Case Time Complexity:</b> O(n). The best case occurs when an array is already sorted.</p>
<p><b>Auxiliary Space:</b> O(1)</p>
<p><b>Boundary Cases:</b> Bubble sort takes minimum time (Order of n) when elements are already sorted.</p>
<p><b>Sorting In Place:</b> Yes</p>
<p><b>Stable:</b> Yes</p>
<p>Due to its simplicity, bubble sort is often used to introduce the concept of a sorting algorithm. </p>
