<h2>Insertion Sort</h2>
<p>Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works similar to the way you sort playing cards in your hands. The array is virtually split into a sorted and an unsorted part. Values from the unsorted part are picked and placed at the correct position in the sorted part.</p>

<h3>Algorithm</h3>

<p>To sort an array of size n in ascending order:</p>
<p>1: Iterate from arr[1] to arr[n] over the array.</p> 
<p>2: Compare the current element (key) to its predecessor.</p> 
<p>3: If the key element is smaller than its predecessor, compare it to the elements before. Move the greater elements one position up to make space for the swapped element.</p>

<p><b>Time Complexity:</b> O(n^2)</p> 
<p><b>Auxiliary Space:</b> O(1)</p>
<p><b>Boundary Cases:</b> Insertion sort takes maximum time to sort if elements are sorted in reverse order. And it takes minimum time (Order of n) when elements are already sorted.</p>
<p><b>Algorithmic Paradigm:</b> Incremental Approach</p>
<p><b>Sorting In Place:</b> Yes</p>
<p><b>Stable:</b> Yes</p>
<p><b>Online:</b> Yes</p>
<p><b>Uses:</b> Insertion sort is used when number of elements is small. It can also be useful when input array is almost sorted, only few elements are misplaced in complete big array.</p>
